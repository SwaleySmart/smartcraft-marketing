# Final Comprehensive PRD: Smartcraft Marketing Website

## 1. Context

Smartcraft is a **next-generation marketing and software engineering studio**, positioning itself as the **anti-agency**. It leverages **AI, automation, and agentic systems** to deliver enterprise-grade websites, software, and marketing services at the price point of WordPress agencies — but without the bloat, insecurity, and inefficiency of legacy systems.

The marketing website will:

* Showcase Smartcraft's positioning as an **AI-native, agentic, enterprise-ready partner**.
* Differentiate against **WordPress shops** and traditional agencies.
* Present **service packages (Launch, Growth, Dominate)**.
* Demonstrate the **SMART process** framework.
* Enable lead generation and client onboarding.

The system will be built with **Laravel 12 + Statamic (latest)** on the backend, **Inertia.js + Vue 3 (latest) + Vite (latest) + Tailwind (latest)** on the frontend.

Supporting documentation:

* `/docs/analyst/` – market research, positioning, packages, messaging
* `/docs/architect/` – system architecture, page builder, block specs
* `/docs/ux/` – wireframes, design system
* `/docs/po/` – backlog refinements, QA checklists

## 2. Goals

* 🚀 Establish Smartcraft as the **AI-native anti-agency**.
* 🏗️ Deliver a flexible, scalable **Page Builder**.
* 🔒 Ensure **enterprise-grade security, performance, and DevOps**.
* 📊 Present **packages, SMART process, analytics** in a compelling way.
* 📈 Drive **leads and conversions** via advanced CTAs, estimators, and forms.
* 🎨 Provide a **UI/UX experience** that feels futuristic, credible, and conversion-focused.

## 3. Non-Goals

* No gated portals, memberships, or account logins (MVP).
* No multilingual/multisite support initially.
* No custom search engine (use Statamic native first).
* No deep CRM integrations at MVP (basic form → email/webhook).
