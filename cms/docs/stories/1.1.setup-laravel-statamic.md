## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-05

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**🚨 MULTIPLE CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

**1. Version Mismatch - Laravel Foundation**
- **CRITICAL**: Laravel 10.10 installed but requirements specify Laravel 12.x
- This is a major version discrepancy affecting security, features, and upgrade path

**2. Database Architecture Misalignment**
- Statamic configured for database storage (`'repository' => 'eloquent'`) instead of flat-file
- Contradicts architectural decision for "flat-file CMS without database complexity"
- Creates mixed storage approach: content in flat-files, users in database

**Positive Aspects:**
- Frontend versions correct: Vue 3.5.21, Tailwind 4.1.13, TypeScript 5.9.2
- Project structure matches architecture exactly
- Inertia.js + Vue integration properly configured

### Refactoring Performed

None performed - these architectural and version issues require team discussion before modification.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Code follows standards where implemented
- Project Structure: ✓ Directory structure matches architecture exactly  
- Testing Strategy: ✗ **No setup validation tests implemented**
- Version Requirements: ✗ **CRITICAL - Laravel major version mismatch**
- All ACs Met: ✗ **Multiple critical issues prevent AC completion**

### Improvements Checklist

**Must Fix Immediately (Blocking Issues):**
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Upgrade to Laravel 12.x as specified in requirements
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Configure Statamic for flat-file user storage (`config/statamic/users.php`)
- [ ] Verify all Laravel dependencies are compatible with version 12.x
- [ ] Create flat-file users directory structure
- [ ] Remove database dependency from user authentication

**Must Fix (Test Coverage):**
- [ ] Add setup validation tests for all service startup
- [ ] Add integration test for Statamic control panel access  
- [ ] Add test for Inertia.js page rendering
- [ ] Add version requirement validation tests

**Should Fix:**
- [ ] Document migration from database to flat-file users
- [ ] Add health checks for flat-file storage integrity
- [ ] Verify PHP 8.3+ compatibility with Laravel 12.x

### Security Review

**FAIL**: Mixed storage architecture creates inconsistent security models. Version mismatch exposes project to security vulnerabilities from outdated framework.

### Performance Considerations

**CONCERNS**: Laravel 10 vs 12 performance differences unknown. Mixed storage approach may impact performance predictability.

### Files Modified During Review

None - critical issues require explicit team approval before modification.

### Gate Status

Gate: **FAIL** → docs/qa/gates/1.1-setup-laravel-statamic.yml

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required** - Multiple critical issues block story completion:

1. **Laravel version must be upgraded to 12.x** to match requirements
2. **Database architecture must align with flat-file CMS choice** 
3. **Setup validation tests must be implemented**

**Recommendation**: Stop development until foundation issues are resolved. The version mismatch and architectural inconsistency will impact all future development.
