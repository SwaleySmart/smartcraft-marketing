- Password Policy: Statamic's built-in password requirements

## Performance Optimization

- Caching Strategy: Browser caching + Cloudflare edge caching

**Backend Performance:**
- Response Time Target: < 500ms average response time
- Database Optimization: Query optimization, proper indexing
- Caching Strategy: Redis application cache + Statamic static cache
