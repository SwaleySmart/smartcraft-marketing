# SMART Process (Delivery Framework)

**S.M.A.R.T** — end-to-end delivery methodology:

* **S – Sense & Scope**: discovery, constraints, goals → Discovery Brief.
* **M – Model & Map**: PRD + Architecture (IA, data flows, APIs).
* **A – Articulate & Artify**: Lo-fi wireframes → Hi-fi design.
* **R – Realize & Release**: development, DevOps, CI/CD, observability.
* **T – Test & Tune**: QA, perf/a11y, CRO, SEO hardening, analytics feedback.

Outputs: Discovery Brief → PRD → Architecture → Wireframes → Design → Build → QA → Launch → Post-Launch Optimisation.

# Copy Angles

* **Hero**: "The anti-agency: AI-native, enterprise-grade, WordPress-free."
* **Packages CTA**: "Start SMART →"
* **Anti-WordPress**: "Stop paying for plugin roulette and security firefights."
* **Analytics**: "Own your data. See what GA4 won't. Act faster."
* **DevOps**: "Ship safely, sleep soundly: zero-downtime as default."

# Editorial Governance

* **Voice**: bold, plain-spoken, credible.
* **Banned words**: industry-leading, cutting-edge (unless evidenced).
* **Structure**: outcomes → mechanisms → CTA.
