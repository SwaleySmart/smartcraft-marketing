The marketing website will:

* Showcase Smartcraft‚Äôs positioning as an **AI-native, agentic, enterprise-ready partner**.
* Differentiate against **WordPress shops** and traditional agencies.
* Present **service packages (Launch, Growth, Dominate)**.
* Demonstrate the **SMART process** framework.
* Enable lead generation and client onboarding.

The system will be built with **Laravel 12 + Statamic (latest)** on the backend, **Inertia.js + Vue 3 (latest) + Vite (latest) + Tailwind (latest)** on the frontend.

Supporting documentation:

* `/docs/analyst/` ‚Äì market research, positioning, packages, messaging
* `/docs/architect/` ‚Äì system architecture, page builder, block specs
